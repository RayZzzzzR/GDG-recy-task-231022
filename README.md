# GDG-recy-task-231022

As specified this page contains a new year countdown and a portfolio. Also, added media queries for responsiveness..... 

Left Half : Countdown and a celebration button(click here)

a Celebration button at left bottom, when clicked generates a confetti effect.(i used a confetti.js library for this)

Right Half : (Image + intro) and (about us + Skills)

A simple portfolio container about me.

NOTE :- At time 00:00:00:00 , The whole countdown will be removed and a container showing Happy New Year ! will be visible both before and after images are shown below.

Also, instead of adding a preview button I created a hover functionality such that when we hover on Bye Bye 2024 it will change to 2025 Happy New Year!....
